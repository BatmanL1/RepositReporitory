             <h2 class="center">How gaming was in my interest</h2>

         
             <p> My father loved to play games as much as I do now. Some of his favorite games were street fighter, afro samurai and call of duty. I woke up one day and saw him playing one of the games and I was so immersed. Iwanted to play too but I knew i was too young. I remember one time I thought my dad was letting me play when really he gave me a controller that had no batteries in it. I wanted to play fighting games so I asked my mom if I could get some on my phone she let me get some and this one game had me hooked. It was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maOPgDLzfhc" target="_blank">Call of Mini Infinity</a>  . I was like Halo and Call of Duty combined into one multiplayer game. Another thing is that there were tons of modders and hackers in the game. But that didnt stop me because there were some pretty well known glitches that would give you tons of things or limited time items. I played that game for so long it was like second nature hitting headshots all the time. This is what started getting me into the genre of shooting games.</p>
    
            <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
            <h2 class="center"> How my interest evolved</h2>
    
            <p> I started to really play roblox in 2019. Some of my favorite games were Vehicle simulator Counter Strike and Survive the Disasters. All of those games were difficult to a certain extent. But because I was so young I couldnt play the games extrememly well but I was still very good. I was super into Survive the Disasters that I stayed up all night on the game. I got in trouble because my mom caught me on my laptop early in the morning. I didnt get in trouble much more after tat because I learned to control myself. After I learned out how to control myself my computer charger would not plug in anymore. The computer I had they didnt have any more plugs like that in stock. </p>
    
                        <!-- Paragraph 5 -->
            <h3 class="center"> Why I got tired of games.</h3>

            <p> I was super interested in most of the games on roblox because they would asways have something for me to do. But none of them kept me engaged in the game. I layed more games but i played them less. I came across a few games that I thought were fun but they only had a few people in it. One of the games had moderators in the game which I thought was a pretty rare sighting but if I tried to ask them for something or talk to them they would ignore me. The other game was pretty advanced and challenging. I was pretty bad at first but i practiced until I kind of got it down. However playing against people online in that gme was hard becasue they were all so good. Then next game also had people with more authority than me in it. I had been given a lot of money by someone glitching the system. The higher ups were on a look out for those things and trying to remove all the money somehow.</p>
    
            <h4> I was mad.</h4>

            <p class="box-model"> The game that I had gotten my money glitched to a large amount on was being supervised and I just happen to run into one of the authorities. They were trying to lure people in by saying that theyll change peoples currency into levels. I had no idea that this was a trick. They wanted to eliminate all the people that had gotten the money. I gave the guy all my money along with a few other people. He took our money but didnt give us anything in return. I kept talking to him in the chat asking him but he wouldnt respond. I got mad then becuse I knew id been tricked. This game made me wonder "what if I owned a successful game".</p>
