        <h5 class="center" style="text-transform: uppercase";> Game Development </h5>
        <p class="span-p"> Game development seemed to be pretty easy to me. But I had no idea what i was getting into. I was still only a kid trying to learn how to make games on roblox. I was excited so nothing brought my spirits down. My first game was a game that gave you <span> Free admin commands</span> which let you do things like spawn in gears from the roblox catalog. I tried making my very first map which went ok. It wasnt really my map because I just got it from the toolbox that roblo provides. I just had no idea how to give everyone that entered the game admin. I searched for a lot of youtube videos that I thought would help me figure out the problem. I was stuck watching those videos for a while but they didnt help much. </p>

        <h6 class="center" style="text-transform: uppercase";>A little while after</h6>

        <p> So I started getting used to roblox by now. I was about 12-14 and i had good knowledge over the platform. I was starting to get tired of asking my grandparents for money on roblox. I decided to try and make another game. I knew i didnt really have much of the materials that I needed to make a game but I had some knowledge of animation. At the time i knew a couple of people who were game developers or wanted to be. I decided to take my animation knowledge into roblox because i thought that I was pretty good. I searched on youtube the best way to animate on roblox and had to download a plugin. After I did everything the tutorial asked, I was ready to start doing animation. I tried to do some fighting animations like a few punches or kicks. They looked ok but they werent up to the standards that I wanted them at. I had watched some other roblox animations before going onto the studio and they made it seem way easier than it actually was.</p>

        <h7 class="center" style="text-transform: uppercase";>Going into my first career choice</h7>
        
        <p> About 4 months after my first few animations I realized that some of the fighting games I was looking for were right in front of my eyes. On discord there was a lot of communities of people who play the types of fighting games I liked. At this time the fighting games I was interested in was Project Grappler, Outdoor boxing and Mighty Secunda. I had no idea what discord was and this was how I got on it. Fast forward a 5 more months, im 13 and Mighty Secunda is starting to fade away. And other games are also in the making inbetween this process. I just happen to get in one of the servers for the games and they wanted to hire an animator. I thoguht that this was my chance because I seemed like I was pretty good at it. (i wasnt) I made a couple of animations before applying to the guy and I thought that they were great. I dmed him about applying for the game and showed him my animations. And just like that I was a developer in the game now. Me along another animator.</p>
