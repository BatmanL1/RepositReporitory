     My interest in computers started when i got my first laptop when i was 9. I had an idea how to use it because my grandma had a computer at her house that i would always play on. When got my first laptop i immediatly went to a website with arcade games on it. I played it for a long time. The next day my friends at school were talking about roblox and I wanted to sound cool in the conversation so i told them I had a lot of robux. <b style="color: blue;">Robux is roblox currency</b>

         <p class="center">When i was young i had a big interest in sports. I was good at every sport i played. I had played for the spartans football team for a couple years and i felt like their star runningback. My dad and i loved football as much as we loved watching it. However i liked playing on my computer just as much. At this time i was 10 and I had started playing roblox for a while. Some of my friends played roblox too. We would all sometimes play together. I had minecraft on my laptop but I didnt play it much. However I would continue to watch countless minecraft mod videos on youtube. Sometimes I would still play with my legos because I still thought they were pretty cool. My friend Delano invited me over to his house for my first sleep over one time. I brought my laptop and we played roblox together. We played with nerf guns, shot darts at his sister and played instruments. Delano had a sound keyboard, a piano and drums. The drums were my favorite because I took drumming lessons in the summer. I wasnt as good as him though which inspired me. After our sleepover I wanted to see if his dads computer worked. His computer was not a laptop. I couldnt play on it but i knew when I get home I'm going to ask for a computer like his dads.</p>
