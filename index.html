     My interest in computers started when i got my first laptop when i was 9. I had an idea how to use it because my grandma had a computer at her house that i would always play on. When got my first laptop i immediatly went to a website with arcade games on it. I played it for a long time. The next day my friends at school were talking about roblox and I wanted to sound cool in the conversation so i told them I had a lot of robux. <b>Robux is roblox currency</b>

         <p>When i was young i had a big interest in sports. I was good at every sport i played. I had played for the spartans football team for a couple years and i felt like their star runningback. My dad and i loved football as much as we loved watching it. However i liked playing on my computer just as much. At this time i was 10 and I had started playing roblox for a while. Some of my friends played roblox too. We would all sometimes play together. </p>
