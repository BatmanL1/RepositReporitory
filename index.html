   <p class="center">
     My interest in computers started when i got my first laptop when i was 9. I had an idea how to use it because my grandma had a computer at her house that i would always play on. When got my first laptop i immediatly went to a website with arcade games on it. I played it for a long time. The next day my friends at school were talking about roblox and I wanted to sound cool in the conversation so i told them I had a lot of robux. <b style="color: blue;">Robux is roblox currency</b>

         <!-- Writings 2 -->
         <p class="center">When i was young i had a big interest in sports. I was good at every sport i played. I had played for the spartans football team for a couple years and i felt like their star runningback. My dad and i loved football as much as we loved watching it. However i liked playing on my computer just as much. At this time i was 10 and I had started playing roblox for a while. Some of my friends played roblox too. We would all sometimes play together. I had minecraft on my laptop but I didnt play it much. However I would continue to watch countless minecraft mod videos on youtube. Sometimes I would still play with my legos because I still thought they were pretty cool. My friend Delano invited me over to his house for my first sleep over one time. I brought my laptop and we played roblox together. We played with nerf guns, shot darts at his sister and played instruments. Delano had a sound keyboard, a piano and drums. The drums were my favorite because I took drumming lessons in the summer. I wasnt as good as him though which inspired me. After our sleepover I wanted to see if his dads computer worked. His computer was not a laptop. I couldnt play on it but i knew when I get home I'm going to ask for a computer like his dads.</p>
         
         <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
         <h2 class="center">How gaming was in my interest</h2>

         
         <p> My father loved to play games as much as I do now. Some of his favorite games were street fighter, afro samurai and call of duty. I woke up one day and saw him playing one of the games and I was so immersed. Iwanted to play too but I knew i was too young. I remember one time I thought my dad was letting me play when really he gave me a controller that had no batteries in it. I wanted to play fighting games so I asked my mom if I could get some on my phone she let me get some and this one game had me hooked. It was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maOPgDLzfhc" target="_blank">Call of Mini Infinity</a>  . I was like Halo and Call of Duty combined into one multiplayer game. Another thing is that there were tons of modders and hackers in the game. But that didnt stop me because there were some pretty well known glitches that would give you tons of things or limited time items. I played that game for so long it was like second nature hitting headshots all the time. This is what started getting me into the genre of shooting games.</p>

        <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
        <h2 class="center"> How my interest evolved</h2>

        <p> I started to really play roblox in 2019. Some of my favorite games were Vehicle simulator Counter Strike and Survive the Disasters. All of those games were difficult to a certain extent. But because I was so young I couldnt play the games extrememly well but I was still very good. I was super into Survive the Disasters that I stayed up all night on the game. I got in trouble because my mom caught me on my laptop early in the morning. I didnt get in trouble much more after tat because I learned to control myself. After I learned out how to control myself my computer charger would not plug in anymore. The computer I had they didnt have any more plugs like that in stock. I wanted to try and improvise using my own plug for my phone or something. then i realized thats not how things worked. </p>
