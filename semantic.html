        <h1>Why learning young is best</h1>
        <p>
          Most famous people learned their skills at a very young age and were successful growing up. Learning roblox at a young age is good to because you cna learn their coding language younger and still have the knowledge when your older and more capable.

        <h1> What I learned how to do</h1>
        <p>
         More recently i learned how to make models, do anatomy sculpts and animation in blender. I think blender is a good resource because it has room for improvement which is where the add ons come in. Blender also has easily accessible things. It has some coding in it too so if you wanted to stick with blender it has pretty much everything in it.

        <h1 id="chapter">What is blender</h1>
        <p>
          Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. Advanced users employ Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize the application and write specialized tools; often these are included in Blender’s future releases. Blender is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process.

        <p>
          Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X game engine. The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety of desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms. Unity, as far as I know, is used mostly for game development

        <p class="center">
          Coding hones problem-solving and analysis skills, such as finding errors and thinking logically. Further, coding often helps people develop teamwork and interpersonal skills since software and application projects are often cross-disciplinary and collaborative.
